 **Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning**

**Description:**
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset includes features like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. The model is trained and evaluated using multiple techniques to ensure accuracy and reliability.

**Features:**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection.
- **Modeling:** Implementation of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- **Evaluation:** Metrics include Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.
- **Deployment:** Simple Flask web app for real-time predictions.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Machine Learning
- Data Analysis
- Python Programming
- Model Evaluation
- Web Deployment

**Future Enhancements:**
- Integration of lifestyle factors into the model.
- Deployment on cloud platforms for scalability.
